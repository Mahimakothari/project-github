Before I answer the question, what is Java used for, let me brief you about why you should choose Java. Java is highly popular and has dominated this field from early 2000’s till the present 2018.

Java Definition - What is Java - Edureka

Java is: –

Concurrent where you can execute many statements instead of sequentially executing it.
Class-based and an object-oriented programming language.
Independent programming language that follows the logic of “Write once, Run anywhere” i.e. the compiled code can run on all platforms which supports java.
